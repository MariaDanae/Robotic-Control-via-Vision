# Robotic-Control-via-Vision

The objective of this project is to construct a mobile robot that is able to build a structure which consists of Lego pieces based on real-time feedback from a webcam. The mission is to be completed within the guaranteed time duration of 25 minutes. The workspace consists of a white 3x4 ft2 board which serves as the background of the image. Lego pieces of various colors and sizes will be randomly distributed on half of this workspace. The robot is to be placed in a random location at the starting region. The robot is to identify and localize Lego pieces with use of the webcam which provides imaging feedback. The robot must construct the three alphabet-shaped structures with Lego pieces in the predetermined location. The two Lego dimensions available are small 1.6cm(length) x 1.6cm(width) x 0.96cm(height) and large 3.2cm(length) x 1.6cm(width) x 0.96cm(height). The three colors used for this project are blue, red and green. The structures the robot must construct are the letters U, H, and I. The letters must be aligned horizontally in a straight line.
